# Overview

This project is a simple console-based Note-Taking App written in Kotlin. The goal of this software is to practice and demonstrate core Kotlin programming concepts including data classes, mutable lists, functions, loops, conditionals, and safe user input.  

The app allows users to **add, view, edit, and delete notes** from the console. Each note includes a title, content, and an optional category. This project helped me learn how to structure a Kotlin program with classes and functions while handling user input in a safe and beginner-friendly way.  

The purpose of writing this software was to **strengthen my understanding of Kotlin syntax, data classes, collections, and program flow** in a real-world, interactive console application.

# Development Environment

- **Programming Language:** Kotlin
- **JetBrains IDEA:** IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition   
- **JDK:** OpenJDK 25  
- **Libraries:** No extra external libraries used - only standard Kotlin library features  

The development was done entirely in IntelliJ, which provides built-in support for Kotlin, code completion, and console execution for easy testing.

# Future Work

- Add **persistent storage** so notes are saved to a file or database and can be referenced later.  
- Implement **search and filter** functionality for notes.  
- Add **enhanced input validation** and error handling for more robust user experience.  
- Improve UI to make console output easier to read.
